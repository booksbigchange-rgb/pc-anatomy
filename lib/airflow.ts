/**
 * Where the air goes.
 *
 * Every fan in this project is drawn in detail and none of them said anything
 * about the one thing a fan is for. A viewer could count the blades on the
 * front intakes and still not know that those three and the one at the back
 * are a single path through the machine, or that the tower cooler stands in
 * that path on purpose, or why the shroud under the graphics card is cut.
 *
 * So: chevrons, marching along authored paths. Three decisions behind that.
 *
 * **The paths are authored, not derived.** It would be tidier to read each
 * fan's transform and blow air along its axis, and it would have been wrong:
 * `buildFan` disagrees with itself about which face is the intake (the lit
 * ring and the finger guard sit on +Y, documented as the intake face, while
 * the builder's own header claims it blows along +Y), and several callers
 * mount their fans from the header rather than from the ring. Air that
 * follows the geometry would therefore leave the case through the front
 * panel. Each builder states the path its build actually moves air along,
 * which is a claim about the hardware rather than about a transform.
 *
 * **It is scenery, not a part.** Airflow carries `contextFrame`, so it is
 * never selected, never named, never laid out in the inventory and never
 * pointed at: the chevrons opt out of raycasting entirely, or the front of
 * the machine would answer the cursor with an arrow instead of a fan.
 *
 * **It belongs to the assembled machine.** Air moves through a machine that
 * is closed. The moment the slider leaves zero the claim stops being true, so
 * the chevrons are gone within the first tenth of the disassembly rather than
 * hanging over a tray of separated parts. `airflowStrength` is that curve.
 *
 * Colour carries the one fact a direction cannot: air leaves hotter than it
 * arrives. Cool blue entering, warm amber leaving, and the ramp between them
 * spread along whatever the stream crosses.
