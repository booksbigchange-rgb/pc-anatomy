/**
 * Surface finishes, authored from how the real parts are actually finished.
 *
 * A computer case is not one grey. A mid-tower is four or five distinct
 * finishes sitting next to each other, and it is the *difference* between them
 * that reads as a manufactured product rather than as a pile of boxes:
 *
 *   · fine-texture black powder coat on the folded steel shell
 *   · bead-blasted anodised aluminium on the extruded corner columns and trim
 *   · brushed aluminium on machined faces, heat spreaders and coldplates
 *   · bright nickel and bare copper inside a cooler
 *   · low-gloss moulded ABS on fan frames, connector bodies and bezels
 *   · low-iron tempered glass in the window
 *
 * Two things separate those finishes for the eye, and neither is colour.
 *
 * The first is *grain direction*. Powder coat is isotropic speckle; brushed
 * aluminium is a strongly directional streak; anodised aluminium is a very
 * fine blasted matte. Reusing one noise map for all three is exactly what made
 * every panel here read as the same injection-moulded plastic.
 *
 * The second is *how tight the highlight is*. Roughness under about 0.3 gives
 * the small, hard reflection of machined metal; 0.55-0.7 gives the broad soft
 * sheen of powder coat; above 0.8 gives the near-flat look of rubber. Held
 * constant across a face, any of them still reads as plastic, so every finish
 * below also varies its own roughness across the surface with a map.
 *
 * Nothing here is downloaded. Every map is drawn to a canvas at build time
 * from a seeded generator, so the same build always produces the same surface.
